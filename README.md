# Guild Wars 2: Cost Estimator of Leveling Magic Find GUI
Python version: 3.9.19

This is a GUI for estimating the cost of leveling one's Magic Find through the most direct route of purchasing Globs of Ectoplasm from the Trading Post, salvaging said Ectos, eating the resultant Luck, and selling the resultant Piles of Crystalline Dust back on the Trading Post. It is designed to provide a reasonable estimate (based on the information from various relevant https://wiki.guildwars2.com/ articles listed below) of said costs as a reflection of CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS.

Assumptions:
  1) The user will salvage 100% of the Globs of Ectoplasm they purchase from the Trading Post.
  2) The user will sell 100% of the resultant Piles of Crystalline Dust back to the Trading Post.
  3) Any Buy/Sell orders made buy the user will successfully buy/sell without the need for re-listing.
